# Alzheimer-Stage-Detector
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Alzheimer's stage detection. The model is trained to analyze brain imaging data and classify the stage of Alzheimer's disease based on the input images.

## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate staging of the disease can help in providing appropriate care and treatment to patients. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to develop a model capable of detecting and classifying the different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate the Alzheimer's stage detection model, we used a publicly available dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images. Size of the dataset is 34.7MB. The dataset consists of two files - Training and Testing both containing a total of around ~5000 images each segregated into the severity of Alzheimer's
